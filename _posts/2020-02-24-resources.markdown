## Say something

The reason why I wrote this article is because I think everything should be sharable so that people can make progress. 

Leave a comment if you know some awesome resources.


* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
It's a online LaTeX editor. You can share your work with other colleages.
* [WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/)
WikiCFP is a semantic wiki for Calls For Papers in science and technology fields. There are about 50,000 CFPs on WikiCFP. Over 100,000 researchers use WikiCFP each month.
* [SCI-HUB](https://sci-hub.se/)
The first website in the world to provide mass & public access to research papers.
* [Arxiv Sanity Preserver](https://www.arxiv-sanity.com/)
Web interface for browsing, search and filtering recent arxiv submissions.
* [Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/)
Entering tables in LaTeX documents can be burdensome because of the necessary formatting directives. For this purpose we created this online generator which (hopefully) will allow you to generate LaTeX code you can just copy & paste into your document's source. Our editor is close to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Got) principle, i.e. the table displayed in the editor should resemble the final table.
